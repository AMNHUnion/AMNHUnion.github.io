    <mark style="color: white; background-color:DarkBlue"> Reduction in number of layoffs in Spring 2020 and earlier for union members: </mark>
  <br>
   <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Early in the pandemic, out of 91 union members, the union ensured that only 3 were laid off, instead of 17 targeted by the museum. In particular:</li>
    <li>Two of the 11 Exhibition Preparators were targeted, but the union negotiated for them to keep
their jobs.</li>
    <li>The union moved members to other titles/depts to prevent layoffs.</li>
    <li>The union also moved members between locals to prevent layoffs.</li>
    <li>Several senior members were able to qualify for early retirement and left with a generous
      severance package.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, the union contract prevents the museum from laying off the workers with the most
      seniority, and therefore the highest earnings.</li>
